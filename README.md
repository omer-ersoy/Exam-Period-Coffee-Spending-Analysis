# Exam-Period-Coffee-Spending-Analysis

## Description
An analysis of my personal spending data on coffee purchases during midterm and final exam periods.
##
## Motivation
Exams are known to be stressful periods for students, often leading to changes in daily routines, including increased caffeine consumption. This project aims to investigate whether my spending on coffee significantly increases during midterm and final exam periods compared to regular weeks. Through this analysis, I aim to uncover patterns in my behavior and explore whether these trends align with general assumptions about exam stress and caffeine dependence.
## Data Source
- **Midterm and Final Exam Dates:**
  Exam schedules will be sourced from the university's academic calendar or personal study schedule.
- **Spending Data:**
  My personal bank statements or transaction history, filtered for coffee shop purchases (e.g., Starbucks, EspressoLab, Coffy), will serve as the primary dataset. These data include:
  - Transaction date.
  - Merchant name.
  - Transaction amount.
## Data Analysis Plan
- **Data Cleaning:**
  - Filter transactions to include only coffee-related purchases.
  - Define "exam periods" (e.g., one week before and during the midterm/final dates).
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
  - Create time-series visualizations of coffee purchases over the semester.
  - Compare spending trends during exam periods versus regular periods.
- **Statistical Analysis:**
  - Perform a t-test or similar statistical test to evaluate whether spending during exam periods is significantly higher than during regular weeks.
- **Visualization:**
  - Use bar charts, line graphs, or heatmaps to present findings visually.
